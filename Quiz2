Thank you. Your submission for this quiz was received.
You submitted this quiz on Sat 15 Aug 2015 11:00 PM CDT. You got a score of 10.00 out of 10.00.

Question 1
Suppose I define the following function in R
cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}
What is the result of running
cube(3)
in R after defining this function?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
The users is prompted to specify the value of 'n'.			
An error is returned because 'n' is not specified in the call to 'cube'			
The number 27 is returned	Correct	1.00	Because 'n' is not evaluated, it is not needed even though it is a formal argument.
A warning is given with no value returned.			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 2
The following code will produce a warning in R.
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
        x <- 0
}
Why?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
You cannot set 'x' to be 0 because 'x' is a vector and 0 is a scalar.			
There are no elements in 'x' that are greater than 5			
The expression uses curly braces.			
'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.	Correct	1.00	
The syntax of this R expression is incorrect.			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 3
Consider the following function
f <- function(x) {
        g <- function(y) {
                y + z
        }
        z <- 4
        x + g(x)
}
If I then run in R
z <- 10
f(3)
What value is returned?

Question 4
Consider the following expression:
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
        NA
} else {
        10
}
What is the value of 'y' after evaluating this expression?

Question 5
Consider the following R function
h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
        z <- cbind(x, d)
        if(!is.null(y))
                z <- z + y
        else
                z <- z + f
        g <- x + y / z
        if(d == 3L)
                return(g)
        g <- g + 10
        g
}
Which symbol in the above function is a free variable?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
f	Correct	1.00	
z			
d			
L			
g			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 6
What is an environment in R?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
an R package that only contains data			
a list whose elements are all functions			
a collection of symbol/value pairs	Correct	1.00	
a special type of function			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 7
The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
compilation scoping			
global scoping			
lexical scoping	Correct	1.00	
dynamic scoping			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 8
How are free variables in R functions resolved?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined	Correct	1.00	
The values of free variables are searched for in the working directory			
The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was called			
The values of free variables are searched for in the global environment			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 9
What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Functions cannot be nested			
R objects cannot be larger than 100 MB			
All objects can be stored on the disk			
All objects must be stored in memory	Correct	1.00	
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 10
In R, what is the parent frame?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
It is always the global environment			
It is the environment in which a function was defined			
It is the package search list			
It is the environment in which a function was called	Correct	1.00	
Total		1.00 / 1.00
