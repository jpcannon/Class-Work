Thank you. Your submission for this quiz was received.
You submitted this quiz on Sat 29 Aug 2015 6:47 PM CDT. You got a score of 10.00 out of 10.00.

Question 1
What is produced at the end of this snippet of R code?
set.seed(1)
rpois(5, 2)
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
A vector with the numbers 3.3, 2.5, 0.5, 1.1, 1.7			
A vector with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 4, 1	Correct	1.00	Because the `set.seed()' function is used, `rpois()' will always output the same vector in this code.
A vector with the numbers 1, 4, 1, 1, 5			
It is impossible to tell because the result is random			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 2
What R function can be used to generate standard Normal random variables?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
pnorm			
dnorm			
rnorm	Correct	1.00	Functions beginning with the `r' prefix are used to simulate random variates.
qnorm			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

Standard probability distributions in R have a set of four functions that can be used to simulate variates, evaluate the density, evaluate the cumulative density, and evaluate the quantile function.
Question 3
When simulating data, why is using the set.seed() function important?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
It can be used to generate non-uniform random numbers.			
It can be used to specify which random number generating algorithm R should use, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.	Correct	1.00	
It ensures that the random numbers generated are within specified boundaries.			
It ensures that the sequence of random numbers is truly random.			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 4
Which function can be used to evaluate the inverse cumulative distribution function for the Poisson distribution?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
rpois			
dpois			
ppois			
qpois	Correct	1.00	Probability distribution functions beginning with the `q' prefix are used to evaluate the quantile (inverse cumulative distribution) function.
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 5
What does the following code do?
set.seed(10)
x <- rep(0:1, each = 5)
e <- rnorm(10, 0, 20)
y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Generate uniformly distributed random data			
Generate data from a Poisson generalized linear model			
Generate data from a Normal linear model	Correct	1.00	
Generate random exponentially distributed data			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 6
What R function can be used to generate Binomial random variables?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
dbinom			
pbinom			
rbinom	Correct	1.00	
qbinom			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 7
What aspect of the R runtime does the profiler keep track of when an R expression is evaluated?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
the function call stack	Correct	1.00	
the global environment			
the package search list			
the working directory			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 8
Consider the following R code
library(datasets)
Rprof()
fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
Rprof(NULL)
(Assume that y, x1, and x2 are present in the workspace.) Without running the code, what percentage of the run time is spent in the 'lm' function, based on the 'by.total' method of normalization shown in 'summaryRprof()'?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
It is not possible to tell			
23%			
100%	Correct	1.00	When using `by.total' normalization, the top-level function (in this case, `lm()') always takes 100% of the time.
50%			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 9
When using 'system.time()', what is the user time?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
It is the "wall-clock" time it takes to evaluate an expression			
It is a measure of network latency			
It is the time spent by the CPU waiting for other tasks to finish			
It is the time spent by the CPU evaluating an expression	Correct	1.00	
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 10
If a computer has more than one available processor and R is able to take advantage of that, then which of the following is true when using 'system.time()'?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
user time is 0			
elapsed time is 0			
elapsed time may be smaller than user time	Correct	1.00	
user time is always smaller than elapsed time			
Total		1.00 / 1.00
