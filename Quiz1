Authentication is not required for this quiz.
You submitted this quiz on Sun 9 Aug 2015 4:31 PM CDT. You got a score of 20.00 out of 20.00.

Introduction
This first quiz will check your ability to execute basic operations on objects in R and to understand some basic concepts. For questions 11–20 you will need to load a dataset into R and do some basic manipulations in order to answer the questions on the quiz.

You may want to print a copy of the quiz questions to look at as you work on the assignment. It is recommended that you save your answers as you go in the event that a technical problem should occur with your network connection or computer. Ultimately, you must submit the quiz online to get credit!

Question 1
R was developed by statisticians working at
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Harvard University			
The University of New South Wales			
StatSci			
The University of Auckland	Correct	1.00	The R language was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman who were statisticians at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

Question 2
The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software.	Correct	1.00	This is not part of the free software definition. Freedoms 1 and 3 require access to the source code.
The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.			
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.			
The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 3
In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
data frame	Correct	1.00	'data frame' is not an atomic data type in R.
numeric			
complex			
character			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 4
If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
matrix			
numeric	Correct	1.00	
real			
list			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 5
What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
matrix			
integer			
list			
numeric	Correct	1.00	The numeric class is the "lowest common denominator" here and so all elements will be coerced into that class.
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

R does automatic coercion of vectors so that all elements of the vector are the same data class.
Question 6
If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
a numeric matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns	Correct	1.00	The 'cbind' function treats vectors as if they were columns of a matrix. It then takes those vectors and binds them together column-wise to create a matrix.
a vector of length 2			
a 2 by 2 matrix			
a vector of length 3			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 7
A key property of vectors in R is that

elements of a vector can only be character or numeric			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 8

an integer vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 6.			
a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.	Correct	1.00	
a numeric vector with elements 1, 2, 3, 6.			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question 10
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
x[x >= 11] <- 4	Correct	1.00	You can create a logical vector with the expression x >= 11 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.
x[x > 10] == 4			
x[x == 4] > 10			
x[x < 10] <- 4			
Total		1.00 / 1.00
